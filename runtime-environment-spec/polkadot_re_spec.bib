@article{zamyatin_xclaim:_nodate,
	title = {{XCLAIM}: {Trustless}, {Interoperable}, {Cryptocurrency}-{Backed} {Assets}},
	abstract = {Building trustless cross-blockchain trading protocols is challenging. Centralized exchanges thus remain the preferred route to execute transfers across blockchains. However, these services require trust and therefore undermine the very nature of the blockchains on which they operate. To overcome this, several decentralized exchanges have recently emerged which offer support for atomic cross-chain swaps (ACCS). ACCS enable the trustless exchange of cryptocurrencies across blockchains, and are the only known mechanism to do so. However, ACCS suffer signiﬁcant limitations; they are slow, inefﬁcient and costly, meaning that they are rarely used in practice.},
