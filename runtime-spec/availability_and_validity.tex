\chapter{Availability and Validity Verification}

\section{Introduction}

Validators are responsible for guaranteeing the validity and availability of PoV
blocks. There are two phases of validation that takes place in the AnV protocol.
\newline

The primary validation check is carried out by parachain validators who are
assigned to the parachain which has produced the PoV block as described in
Section \ref{sect-primary-validation}. Once parachain validators have validated
a parachain's PoV block successfully, they have to announce that according to
the procedure described in Section \ref{sect-primary-validaty-announcement}
where they generate a statement that includes the parachain header with the new
state root and the XCMP message root. This candidate receipt and attestations,
which carries signatures from other parachain validators is put on the relay
chain.
\newline

As soon as the proposal of a PoV block is on-chain, the parachain validators
break the PoV block into erasure-coded pieces as described in Section
\ref{defn-erasure-coded-pieces} and distribute them among all validators. See
Section \ref{sect-distribute-pieces} for details on how this distribution takes
place.
\newline

Once validators have received erasure-coded pieces for several PoV blocks for
the current relay chain block (that might have been proposed a couple of blocks
earlier on the relay chain), they announce that they have received the erasure
coded pieces on the relay chain by voting on the received pieces, see Section
\ref{sect-voting-on-availability} for more details.
\newline

As soon as $>2/3$ of validators have made this announcement for any parachain
block we \emph{act on} the parachain block. Acting on parachain blocks means we
update the relay chain state based on the candidate receipt and considered the
parachain block to have happened on this relay chain fork.
\newline

After a certain time, if we did not collect enough signatures approving the
availability of the parachain data associated with a certain candidate receipt
we decide this parachain block is unavailable and allow alternative blocks to be
built on its parent parachain block, see \ref{sect-unavailability}.
\newline

The secondary check described in Section \ref{sect-approval-checking}, is done
by one or more randomly assigned validators to make sure colluding parachain
validators may not get away with validating a PoV block that is invalid and not
keeping it available to avoid the possibility of being punished for the attack.
\newline

During any of the phases, if any validator announces that a parachain block is
invalid then all validators obtain the parachain block and check its validity,
see Section \ref{sect-escalation} for more details.
\newline

All validity and invalidity attestations go onto the relay chain, see Section
\ref{sect-publishing-attestations} for details. If a parachain block has been
checked at least by certain number of validators, the rest of the validators
continue with voting on that relay chain block in the GRANDPA protocol. Note
that the block might be challenged later.
\newline

\section{Preliminaries}

\begin{definition}
In the remainder of this chapter we assume that $\rho$ is a Polkadot Parachain
and $B$ is a block which has been produced by $\rho$ and is supposed to be
approved to be $\rho$'s next block. By $R_{\rho}$ we refer to runtime code of
parachain $\rho$  as a WASM Blob.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-witness-proof}
  The {\b witness proof} of block $B$, denoted by {\bf $\pi_B$}, is the set of
  all the external data which has gathered while the $\rho$ runtime executes
  block $B$. The data suffices to re-execute $R_{\rho}$ against $B$ and achieve
  the final state indicated in the $H(B)$.
\end{definition}

This witness proof consists of light client proofs of state data that are
generally Merkle proofs for the parachain state trie.  We need this because
validators do not have access to the parachain state, but only have the state
root of it.

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-pov-block}
  Accordingly we define the {\bf proof of validity block} or {\bf PoV} block in
  short, {\bf $\PoVB$}, to be the tuple:
  \[
  (B, \pi_B)
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}  \label{defn-extra-validation-data}
  The \textbf{extra validation data} $v_B$  is an extra input to the validation
  function, i.e. additional data from the relay chain state that is needed.
  It's a tuple of the following format:
  \[
  (Max^{R}_{size}, Max^{head}_{size}, H_i(B^{relay}_{chain}), Head_p(B), \mathbb{B}, Blake2b(R_\rho), R_u)
  \]

  where each value represents:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item $Max^{R}_{size}$: the maximum amount of bytes of the parachain Wasm code
    permitted.
    \item $Max^{head}_{size}$: the maximum amount of bytes of the head data
    (Def. \ref{defn-head-data}) permitted.
    \item $H_i(B^{relay}_{chain})$: the relay chain block number this is in the
    context of.
    \item $Head_p(B)$: the head data (Def. \ref{defn-head-data}) of the parachain.
    \item $\mathbb{B}$: the balance of the parachain at the moment of validation \todo{@fabio: clarify}.
    \item $Blake2b(R_\rho)$: the 32-byte Blake2 hash of the parachain Wasm code.
    \item $R_u$: the  is a varying data type as defined in Definition X
    \todo{@fabio} and can be one of the following values:

    \begin{equation*}
      R_u =
      \begin{cases}
        0, & \text{None} \\
        1, & \text{followed by: } H_i(B_n)
      \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
  \end{itemize}

  $R_u$ implies whether the parachain is allowed to upgrade its validation code.
  If it's of type $1$, it contains the number of the minimum relay chain height
  at which the upgrade will be applied, assuming a upgrade is currently signaled
  \todo{@fabio: where is this signaled?}
  \newline

  Parachain validators get this extra validation data from the current relay
  chain state. Note that a PoV block can be paired with different extra
  validation data depending on when and which relay chain fork it is included
  in. Future validators would need this extra validation data because since the
  candidate receipt as defined in Definition \ref{defn-candidate-receipt} was
  included on the relay chain the needed relay chain state may have changed.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-blob}
  Accordingly we define the {\bf erasure coding blob} or {\bf blob} in short,
  {\bf $\bar{B}$} to be the tuple:
  \[
  (B, \pi_B, v_B)
  \]
\end{definition}

Note that in the code the blob is referred to as "AvailableData".

\subsection{Primary Validation Disagreement}
\label{sect-primary-validation-disagreemnt}
\syed{Parachain}{verify} validators need to keep track of candidate receipts
(see Definition \ref{defn-candidate-receipt}) and validation failure messages of
their peers. In case, there is a disagreement among the parachain validators
about $\bar{B}$, all parachain validators must invoke Algorithm
\ref{algo-primary-validation-disagreemnt}

\begin{algorithm}[H]

\section{Availability}

\todo{@fabio: remove this paragraph}
When a $v \in \paraValidSet$ observes that a block containing parachain block
candidate receipt is included in a relay chain block $RB_p$ then it must invoke
Algorithm \ref{algo-erasure-encode}.
\newline

Backed candidates must be widely available for the entire, elected validators
set without requiring each of those to maintain a full copy. PoV blocks get
broken up into erasure-encoded chunks and each validators keep track of how
those chunks are distributed among the validator set. When a validator has to
verify a PoV block, it can request the chunk for one of its peers.

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-erasure-encoder-decoder}
  The {\bf erasure encoder/decoder} {\bf $encode_{k,n}/decoder_{k,n}$ } is
  defined to be the Reed-Solomon encoder defined in \cite{??}.
\end{definition}

      \State \textsc{Add}($Shards, data$)
    \EndFor
    \Return $Shards$
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-erasure-coded-pieces}
  The {\bf set of erasure encode pieces} of $\bar{B}$, denoted by:
  \[
   Er_B := {(e_1, m_1),...,(e_n,m_n)}
   \]
   is defined to be the output of the Algorithm \ref{algo-erasure-encode}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-erasure-chunk}
  A \textbf{chunk of erasure-encoded block} data is a tuple of the following format:
  \[
    (Enc_{SC}(b_0, .. b_n), \mathbb{I}, \mathbb{P})
  \]

  where each value represents:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $Enc_{SC}(b_0, .. b_n)$: the erasure-encoded chunk of data belonging
    to the candidate block.

    First, the extra validation data, $v_B$ is split into "shards", based on the
    amount of validators the the validator set. There are two types of shards;
    data shards and parity shards.
    \begin{alignat*}{2}
      f &= \frac{(|\paraValidSet| - 1)}{3} \\
      Shard_{data} &= f + 1 \\
      Shard_{parity} &= |\paraValidSet| - f - 1
    \end{alignat*}

    Additionally:
    \begin{alignat*}{2}
      r &= \frac{|Enc_{SC}(v_B)|}{Shard_{data}} +
      \begin{cases}
        0 & if |\paraValidSet| \bmod{Shard_{data}} = 0 \\
        1 & if |\paraValidSet| \bmod{Shard_{data}} \neq 0 \\
      \end{cases} \\
      Shard_{len} &= r + (r \bmod{2})
    \end{alignat*}

    \item $\mathbb{I}$: the index of this erasure-encoded chunk of data.
    \item $\mathbb{P}$: is of type $Enc_{SC}(Enc_{SC}(b_0, .. b_n))$ ...
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\section{Distribution of Pieces}\label{sect-distribute-pieces} Following the
computation of $Er_B$, $v$ must construct the $\bar{B}$ Availability message
defined in Definition \ref{defn-pov-erasure-piece-message}. And distribute them
to target validators designated by the Availability Networking Specification
\cite{??}.

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-pov-erasure-piece-message}
        {\b PoV erasure piece message} $M_{PoV_{\bar{B}}}(i)$ is TBS
\end{definition}

\section{Announcing Availability}\label{sect-voting-on-availability}

When validator $v$ receives its designated piece for $\bar{B}$ it needs to
broadcast Availability vote message as defined in
Definition\ref{defn-availability-vote-message}
\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-availability-vote-message}
        {\b Availability vote message} $M_{PoV}^{Avail,v_i}$ TBS
\end{definition}

Some parachains have blocks that we need to vote on the availability of, that is
decided by $> 2/3$ of validators voting for availability. \syed{For 100 parachain
and 1000 validators this will involve putting 100k items of data and processing
them on-chain for every relay chain block, hence we want to use bit operations
that will be very efficient. We describe next what operations the relay chain
runtime uses to process these availability votes.}{this is not really relevant
to the spec}
\newline

For each parachain, the relay chain stores the following data:
%/syed{we store}{what does it mean we store? this need to be clear. Is it a transaction TBS?}: no its not a tx, its in the relay chain state

\textbf{1) availability status, 2) candidate receipt, 3) candidate relay chain block number}

where availability status is one of \{no candidate, to be determined,
unavailable, available\} .

For each block, each validator $v$ signs a message

Sign(bitfield $b_v$, block hash $h_b$)

where the $i$th bit of $b_v$ is $1$ if and only if

\begin{enumerate}
\item the availability status of the candidate receipt is "to be determined" on
the relay chain at block hash $h_b$ \textbf{and}

\item $v$ has the erasure coded piece of the corresponding parachain block to
this candidate receipt.
\end{enumerate}

These signatures go into a relay chain block.

\subsection{Processing on-chain availability data}
This section explains how the availability attestations stored on the relay
chain, as described in Section ??, are processed as follows:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption[]{Relay chain's signature processing}
  \label{algo-singnature-processing}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
%\begin{enumerate}
\State The relay chain stores the last vote from each validator on chain. For each new signature, the relay chain checks if it is for a block in this chain later than the last vote stored from this validator. If it is the relay chain updates the stored vote and updates the bitfield $b_v$ and block number of the vote.
\State For each block within the last $t$ blocks where $t$ is some timeout period, the relay chain computes a bitmask $bm_n$ ($n$ is block number). This bitmask is a bitfield that represents whether the candidate considered in that block is still relevant. That is the $i$th bit of $bm_n$ is $1$ if and only if for the $i$th parachain,
    (a) the availability status is to be determined and
    (b) candidate block number $\leq n$
\State The relay chain initialises a vector of counts with one entry for each parachain to zero. After executing the following algorithm it ends up with a vector of counts  of the number of validators who think the latest candidates is available.
	\begin{enumerate}
    \item The relay chain computes
    $b_v$ and $bm_n$
    where $n$ is the block number of the validator's last vote
   \item For each bit in $b_v$ and $bm_n$
		\begin{itemize}
        \item add the $i$th bit to the $i$th count.
        \end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
\State For each count that is $>2/3$ of the number of validators, the relay chain sets the candidates status to "available". Otherwise, if the candidate is at least $t$ blocks old, then it sets its status to "unavailable".
\State The relay chain acts on available candidates and discards unavailable ones, and then clears the record, setting the availability status to "no candidate". Then the relay chain accepts new candidate receipts for parachains that have "no candidate: status and once any such new candidate receipts is included on the relay chain it sets their availability status as "to be determined".
%\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Based on the result of Algorithm~\ref{algo-signature-processing} the validator
node should mark a parachain block as either available or eventually unavailable
according to definitions \ref{defn-available-parablock-proposal} and
\ref{defn-unavailable-parablock-proposal}
\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-available-parablock-proposal}
        Parachain blocks for which the corresponding blob is  noted on the relay
        chain to be {\b available}, meaning that the candidate receipt has been
        voted to be available by 2/3 validators.
\end{definition}

After a certain time-out in blocks since we first put the candidate receipt on
the relay chain if there is not enough votes of availability the relay chain
logic decides that a parachain block is unavailable, see
\ref{algo-singnature-processing}.

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-unavailable-parachain-block}
       An {\b unavailabile parachain block} is TBS
\end{definition}

/syed{}{So to be clear we are not announcing unavailability we just keep it for
grand pa vote}

\section{Publishing Attestations}
\label{sect-publishing-attestations}
\syed{}{this is out of place. We can mentioned that we have two type of
  (validity) attestations in the intro but we just need to spec each attestation
  in its relevant section (which we did with the candidate receipt). \todo{move
  this to intro}} We have two type of attestations, primary and secondary.
  Primary attestations are signed by the parachain validators and secondary
  attestations are signed by secondary checkers and include the VRF that
  assigned them as a secondary checker into the attestation. Both types of
  attestations are included in the relay chain block as a transaction. For each
  parachain block candidate the relay chain keeps track of which validators have
  attested to its validity or invalidity.

\section{Secondary Approval checking}
\label{sect-approval-checking}
Once a parachain block is acted on we carry the secondary validity/availability
checks as follows. A scheme assigns every validator to one or more PoV blocks to
check its validity, see Section \ref{sect-shot-assignment} for details. An
assigned validator acquires the PoV block (see Section
\ref{sect-obtaining-block}) and checks its validity by comparing it to the
candidate receipt. If validators notices that an equivocation has happened an
additional validity/availability assignments will be made that is described in
Section\ref{sect-equivocation-case}.

\subsection{Approval Checker Assignment}

Validators assign themselves to parachain block proposals as defined in
Definition \ref{defn-para-proposal}. The assignment needs to be random.
Validators use their own VRF to sign the VRF output from the current relay chain
block as described in Section \ref{sect-vrf-comp}. Each validator uses the
output of the VRF to decide the block(s) they are revalidating as a secondary
checker. See Section \ref{one-shot-assigment} for the detail.
\newline

In addition to this assignment some extra validators are assigned to every PoV
block which is descirbed in Section \ref{sect-extra-validation assignment}.

\subsection{VRF computation}
\label{sect-vrf-comp}

Every validator needs to run Algorithm \ref{algo-checker-vrf} for every
Parachain $\rho$ to determines assignments. \todo{Fix this. It is incorrect so
far.}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption[VRF-for-Approval]{\sc VRF-for-Approval($B$, $z$, $s_k$)}
  \label{algo-checker-vrf}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \Require

    $B$: the block to be approved

    $z$: randomness for approval assignment

    $s_k$: session secret key of validator planning to participate in approval

    \State $(\pi, d) \leftarrow {VRF}(H_h(B),sk(z))$
    \State \Return $(\pi,d)$
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Where {\sc VRF} function is defined in \cite{polkadot-crypto-spec}.
\newline

\subsection{One-Shot Approval Checker Assignemnt}
\label{sect-shot-assignment}
Every validator $v$ takes the output of this VRF computed by
\ref{algo-checker-vrf} mod the number of parachain blocks that we were decided
to be available in this relay chain block according to Definition
\ref{defn-available-parablock-proposal} and executed. This will give them the
index of the PoV block they are assigned to and need to check. The procedure is
formalised in \ref{algo-one-shot-assignment}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption[]{\sc OneShotAssignment}
  \label{algo-one-shot-assignment}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Require{}
    %\Ensure{}

    \State TBS
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Extra Approval Checker Assigment}
\label{sect-extra-validation}
Now for each parachain block, let us assume we want $\#VCheck$ validators to
check every PoV block during the secondary checking. Note that $\#VCheck$ is not
a fixed number but depends on reports from collators or fishermen. Lets us
$\#VDefault$ be the minimum number of validator we want to check the block,
which should be the number of parachain validators plus some constant like $2$.
We set

$$\#VCheck = \#VDefault + c_f * \textrm{total fishermen stake}$$ where $c_f$ is
some factor we use to weight fishermen reports. Reports from fishermen about
this
\newline

Now each validator computes for each PoV block a VRF with the input being the
relay chain block VRF concatenated with the parachain index.
\newline

For every PoV bock, every validator compares $\#VCheck - \#VDefault$ to the
output of this VRF and if the VRF output is small enough than the validator
checks this PoV blocks immediately otherwise depending on their difference waits
for some time and only perform a check if it has not seen $\#VCheck$ checks from
validators who either 1) parachain validators of this PoV block 2) or assigned
during the assignment procedure or 3) had a smaller VRF output than us during
this time.
\newline

More fisherman reports can increase $\#VCheck$ and require new checks. We should
carry on doing secondary checks for the entire fishing period if more are
required. A validator need to keep track of which blocks have $\#VCheck$ smaller
than the number of higher priority checks performed. A new report can make us
check straight away, no matter the number of current checks, or mean that we
need to put this block back into this set. If we later decide to prune some of
this data, such as who has checked the block, then we'll need a new approach
here.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption[]{\sc OneShotAssignment}
  \label{algo-extra-assignment}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Require{}
    %\Ensure{}

    \State TBS
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\syed{}{\todo{so assignees are not announcing their assignment just the result
of the approval check I assume}}

\subsection{Additional Checking in Case of
Equivocation}\label{sect-equivocation-case} In the case of a relay chain
equivocation, i.e. a validator produces two blocks with the same VRF, we do not
want the secondary checkers for the second block to be predictable. To this end
we use the block hash as well as the VRF as input for secondary checkers VRF. So
each secondary checker is going to produce twice as many VRFs for each relay
chain block that was equivocated. If either of these VRFs is small enough then
the validator is assigned to perform a secondary check on the PoV block. The
process is formalized in Algorithm \ref{algo-equivocation-assigment}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption[]{\sc EquivocatedAssignment}
  \label{algo-equivocation-assigment}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]

    %%  \Ensure{}

    \State TBS
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\section{The Approval Check}
Once a validator has a VRF which tells them to check a block, they announce this
VRF and attempt to obtain the block. It is unclear yet whether this is best done
by requesting the PoV block from parachain validators or by announcing that they
want erasure coded pieces.

\subsubsection{Retrieval}
\label{sect-retrieval-of-erasure-pieces}
There are two fundamental ways to retrieve a parachain block for checking
validity. One is to request the whole block from any validator who has attested
to its validity or invalidity. Assigned appoval checker $v$ sends
RequestWholeBlock message specified in Definition
\ref{defn-msg-request-whole-block} to \syed{}{any/all} parachain validator in
order to receive the specific parachain block. Any parachain validator receiving
must reply with PoVBlockRespose message defined in Definition
\ref{defn-pov-block-response}

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-pov-block-response}
        {\b PoV Block Respose} Message TBS
\end{definition}

The second method is to retrieve enough erasure coded pieces to reconstruct the
block from them. In the latter cases an announcement of the form specified in
Definition has to be gossiped to all validators indicating that one needs the
erasure coded pieces.

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-erasure-coded-pieces-request}
        {\b Erasure coded pieces request message} TBS
\end{definition}

On their part, when a validator  receive a erasure coded pieces request message
it response with the message specified in Definition
\ref{defn-erasure-coded-pieces-response}.

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-erasure-coded-pieces-response}
        {\b Erasure coded pieces response message} TBS
\end{definition}

Assigned appoval checker $v$ must retrieve enough erasure pieces of the block
they are verifying to be able to reconstruct the block and the erasure pieces
tree.

%%To that aim the %We never consider substructure of $B$ to be meaningful, so
%$V$ must {\em retrieve} the full {\em candidate proof-of-validity blob}
%$\bar{B}$ before checking.  Now $V$ knows which which nodes have their
%individual pieces, thanks to their availability announcements.  It thus follows
%from our 2/3rd honest assumption that $V$ could always reconstruct $\bar{B}$ by
%obtaining enough pieces $\pieces_B$ from nodes known to posses them.

%We note however that $V$ also knows that all pieces are known by the
%preliminary backing validity checkers aka parachain validators who approved
%$\bar{B}$, as well as approval checkers who already approved $\bar{B}$.  So $V$
%could first contact some node that possesses all of $\bar{B}$, and only then
%begin a full reconstruction process.

%In both cases, $V$ must recompute $\pieces_B$ to verify $\receipt_{B,\cdot}$.
%We therefore cannot see much computational difference between $V$
%reconstructing $\pieces_B$ from arbitrary pieces or from $\bar{B}$ itself.  It
%remains plausible $V$ avoids some networking overhead by asking for $\bar{B}$
%though.  We think a first implementation could reasonably target reconstructing
%$\pieces_B$ from arbitrary pieces, while leaving requests for the full $\bar{B}$
%to future optimisations.

%Ideally $V$ might retrieve the pieces in $\pieces_B$ only using its existing
%connections in our topology specified above, except these intentionally do not
%include 1/3rd of validators.  Also, $V$ need not connect to any node with all
%of $\pieces_B$.  Yet, $V$ should connect to at least one prachain validators in
%$\vals_\rho$ who ideally should check $B$ first.

%We strongly caution against abandoning approval checkers over topology concerns
%because then adversarial influence over the topology could wreck our assignment
%criteria below.

%In fact, our retrieval component could be engineered to avoid requests
%entirely:  After obtaining $\pi_{V,\cdot}$, another validator $V'$ could simply
%compute its own priority for sending its piece from $\pieces_B$ to $V$.  We
%caution that doing do might become inefficient, either because $V$ winds up
%rejecting sends, or when many nodes go offline.

\subsubsection{Reconstruction}
\label{}
After receiving $2f+1$ of erasure pieces every assigned approval checker $v$
needs to recreate the entirety of the erasure code, hence every $v$ will run
Algorithm \ref{algo-reconstruct-pov} to make sure that the code is complete and
the subsequently recover the original $\bar{B}$.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption[Reconstruct-PoV-Erasure]{\sc Reconstruct-PoV-Erasure($S_{Er_B}$)}
  \label{algo-reconstruct-pov-erasure}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \Require
    $S_{Er_B} := {(e_{j_1}, m_{j_1}),\cdot,(e_{j_k}, m_{j_k}))}$ such that $k > 2f$

  %%  \Ensure{}
    \State $\bar{B} \rightarrow$ {\sc Erasure-Decoder}(${e_{j_1},\cdots, e_{j_k}}$)
    \If {{\sc Erasure-Decoder} {\bf failed}}
        \State {\sc Announce-Failure}
        \State \Return
    \EndIf
    \State $Er_B \rightarrow$ {\sc Erasure-Encoder}($\bar{B}$)
    \If {{\sc Verify-Merkle-Proof}($S_{Er_B}$, $Er_B$) {\bf failed}}
      \State {\sc Announce-Failure}
      \State \Return
    \EndIf
    \State \Return $\bar{B}$
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Verification}
%%Verify
%%\If {{\sc Execute}($R_{\rho}$, $\bar{B}$) {\bf failed}}
%%      \State {\sc Announce-Failure}
%%      \State \Return
%%    \EndIf

Once the parachain bock has been obtained or reconstructed the secondary checker
needs to execute the PoV block. We declare a the candidate receipt as invalid if
one one the following three conditions hold: 1) While reconstructing if the
erasure code does not have the claimed Merkle root, 2) the validation function
says that the PoV block is invalid, or 3) the result  of executing the block is
inconsistent with the candidate receipt on the relay chain.

The procedure is formalized in Algorithm


\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption[]{\sc RevalidatingReconstructedPoV}
  \label{algo-revalidating-reconstructed-pov}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Require{}
    %%  \Ensure{}

    \State TBS
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

If everything checks out correctly, we declare the block is valid. This means
gossiping an attestation, including a reference that identifies candidate
receipt and our VRF as specified in Definition
\ref{defn-secondary-appoval-attestation}.

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-secondary-appoval-attestation}
        {\b Secondary approval attetstion message} TBS
\end{definition}


\subsection{Process validity and invalidity messages}
When a Black produced receive a Secondary approval attetstion message, it
execute Algorithm \ref{algo-verify-approval-attestation} to verify the VRF and
may need to judge when enough time has passed.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \caption[]{\sc VerifyApprovalAttestation}
  \label{algo-verify-approval-attestation}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Require{}
    %%  \Ensure{}

    \State TBS
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

These attestations are included in the relay chain as a transaction specified in

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-approval-attestation-transaction}
        {\b Approval Attestation Transaction} TBS
\end{definition}

Collators reports of unavailability and invalidty specified in Definition
\todo{Define these messages} also  go onto the relay chain as well in the format
specified in Definition

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-collator-invalidity-transaction}
        {\b Collator Invalidity Transaction}
        TBS
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{defn-collator-unavailability-transaction}
        {\b Collator unavailability Transaction}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Invalidity Escalation}\label{escalation}

When for any candidate receipt, there are attestations for both its validity and
invalidity, then all validators acquire and validate the blob, irrespective of
the assignments from section by executing Algorithm \ref{algo-reconstruct-pov}
and \ref{algo-revalidating-reconstructed-pov}.
\newline

We do not vote in GRANDPA for a chain were the candidate receipt is executed
until its vote is resolved. If we have $n$ validators, we wait for $>2n/3$ of
them to attest to the blob and then the outcome of this vote is one of the
following:
\newline

If $>n/3$ validators attest to the validity of the blob and $\leq n/3$ attest to
its invalidity, then we can vote on the chain in GRANDPA again and slash
validators who attested to its invalidity.
\newline

If $>n/3$ validators attest to the invalidity of the blob and $\leq n/3$ attest
to its validity, then we consider the blob as invalid. If the rely chain block
where the corresponding candidate receipt was executed was not finalised, then
we never vote on it or build on it. We slash the validators who attested to its
validity.
\newline

If $>n/3$ validators attest to the validity of the blob and $>n/3$ attest to its
invalidity then we consider the blob to be invalid as above but we do not slash
validators who attest either way. We want to leave a reasonable length of time
in the first two cases to slash anyone to see if this happens.
