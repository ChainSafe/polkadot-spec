\section{Transaction}

A transaction is a SCALE encoded array consisting of a version number,
signature, and varying data types indicating the resulting Runtime function to
be called, including the parameters required for that function to be executed.
\newline

\[
    tx := (T_v, P)
\]

Type $P$ is different for each version.

\subsection{Preliminaries}

\begin{definition}
    \label{defn-transaction-version}
    $T_v$ defines the transaction version. The Runtime handles transactions and
    its validity differently based on the version, where the transaction format
    of each version is dictated by the Runtime. This allows Polkadot to evolve
    with new and more advanced transaction formats, while still being able to
    correctly execute older formats.
    \newline

    $T_v$ does not consist of the version number directly, rather the version
    number is manipulated with bitwise operators in order to indicate whether
    the transaction is signed or unsigned.
    \newline

    \newline

    If the transaction is \textbf{signed}, $T_v$ is defined as:

    \[
        T_v := n \ | \ 1000 \ 0000
    \]

    where $n$ is the version number and $|$ implies a bitwise OR operator.
    \newline

    If the transaction is \textbf{unsigned}, $T_v$ is defined as:

    \[
        T_v := n \ \& \ 0111 \ 1111
    \]

    where $n$ is the version number and $\&$ implies a bitwise AND operator.
    \newline

    As an example, for transaction format version 4, an unsigned transaction
    represents $T_v$ as \verb|4| while a signed transaction represents it as
    \verb|132|.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Version 4}

Version 4 of the Polkadot transaction format is defined as follows:

\[
    P := Sig, M_i, F_i(m)
\]

$Sig$ can ...
\newline

$M_i$ is an indicator for the Runtime to which Polkadot \textit{module}, $m$,
the transaction should be forwarded to. The second item, $F_i(m)$, indicates
which \textit{function} (the actual transaction) of the specified module should
be executed.
\newline

$M_i$ is a varying data types pointing to every module exposed to the network.

\[
M_i :=
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{System} \\
1, & \text{Utility} \\
... & \\
7, & \text{Balances} \\
... &
\end{cases}
\]

The $F_i(m)$ indicator varies for each module, since every module has different
functions. As an example, the \verb|Balances| module offers the following
functions:

\[
F(Balances)_i :=
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{transfer} \\
1, & \text{set\_balance} \\
2 & \text{force\_transfer} \\
3 & \text{transfer\_keep\_alive} \\
\end{cases}
\]

As an example, the \verb|transfer| function takes two parameters,
